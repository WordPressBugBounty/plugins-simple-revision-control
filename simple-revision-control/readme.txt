== Description ==

Easily control and limit post revisions per post type to keep your WordPress database clean and optimized—no coding required!


***Simple Revision Control*** is a WordPress plugin that provides an easy way to manage and limit the number of post revisions stored for each post type on your site. Unlike editing the wp-config.php file—which only allows setting a single revision limit for all post types—this plugin lets you specify a different revision limit for each post type individually. You can also enable or disable revision support per post type and delete unwanted revisions directly from the plugin’s settings.

= Key features =

* Set custom revision limits for each post type, rather than a global limit.
* Enable or disable revisions for post types that don’t support them by default.
* Delete all unwanted revisions with a single click to keep your database clean.
* Simple setup and configuration via the WordPress admin under Settings → Revisions.
* No coding required—ideal for users who prefer not to edit wp-config.php.

This plugin is especially useful for site owners who want granular control over revision storage to optimize database performance and avoid unnecessary clutter, without needing to modify core WordPress files.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Should I edit `wp-config.php` file instead install this plugin? =

= Why this plugin is better than the entry in `wp-config.php` file? =

You can set up a number of revisions by post type. Setting in `wp-config.php` file allows setting only one number of revisions for all post types. You can add od remove revisions support per post types. At least you can delete unwanted revisions.
